This is a simple ToDo list website that I built using React. I already tried to make this type of ToDo list before but since I didn't have much knowledge of React, I was unable to add all the functionalities that I wanted. But now as I advanced on the React concepts, I wanted to build this again with all the functions that I wanted to achieve before. Since, I made this project before learning how to write clean and maintainable code, and also I didn't even know how to manage state. So the code is messy, but I was able to achieve the functionality that I desired.
